# US College Data Dashboard
Welcome to my interactive dashboard showcasing data about U.S. colleges, including rankings, tuition costs, and enrollment numbers.

## Project Overview
This app allows users to explore a variety of insights about U.S. colleges in 2022, including:
- **Tuition vs. Rank**: How does tuition cost relate to college rankings?
- **Enrollment Numbers**: Visualize how enrollment changes across different colleges.
- **Rank Tiers**: Understand how tuition and enrollment vary within different rank tiers (Top 10, 11-50, 51+).
- **Interactive Dashboards**: The app provides filters and interactive charts to explore and analyze the data.

## Pages in the App
